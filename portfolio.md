# 9CT Assessment Task 4

## Project Development - Part B

This markdown file will go over the development stages of my final project, from researching to the finished product.

## Identifying And Defining

### Identifying A Need

The first step was to identify a need for my game. I decided to use the Unity engine early on, but what game to make took a bit longer to come up with. I decided to come up with a game idea first and then find the need following that. My ideas were:

- An adventure game about collecting orbs
- A game about an AI vs human war
- A survival game

I decided to go for a survival game. 

**Need:** To simulate a situation in which a person needs to survive for 7 days with no food, water, or shelter at the start. All they will have is an axe. 

**Problem Statement:** Young people need to learn basic survival skills in case they are in a situation where they are in an unfamiliar area, with no food, water, or shelter. This game will teach them techniques such as purifying water, finding food, and building shelter.

**Skill Develepment:** I will utilise [this tutorial by Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFt_AvWsXl0eBW2EiBtl_sxmDtSgZBxB3) on procedural generation (which I have used in the past, such as in my [Ludum Dare 58 project Isle Of The Orbs](https://dreamsphere-games.itch.io/isle-of-the-orbs)) and parts of [this tutorial by Mike's Code](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtLToKUhgzwnk4U2eQYridNnObc2gqWo-) on survival game development, but probably only the parts on the building system.

### Requirements Outline

**Inputs:** User inputs will include: WASD or arrow keys for movement; spacebar for jumping; left click for attacking an enemy, breaking trees/rocks, and placing an item; E for collecting items, and I for opening the inventory

**Processing:** The game will keep track of all enemies killed, the score, and the player's health and hunger; any items that have been collected/placed; trees/rocks that have been destroyed

**Outputs:** The game will display the player's score, any objects that are collected (when they have been collected), the inventory (when opened), the player's health & hunger; and it will play a music track in the background.

**Transmission**: The game may include a multiplayer option, where it will transmit other player's position and currently equipped item

**Storage**: The game may save the player's progress, such as position, any items built, and potentially user settings
